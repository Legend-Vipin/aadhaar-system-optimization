# Executive Summary — Aadhaar Data Analysis Hackathon

## Objective
Analyze Aadhaar enrolment and update datasets to identify patterns, anomalies, and predictive indicators across states and demographic groups. Insights support operational planning, resource allocation, and policy decisions.

## Key Findings

### Temporal Trends
- Enrolments and updates show clear weekly cycles.
- Significant drop in enrolments observed on national and state holidays (~73%).

### Regional Patterns
- Certain states consistently contribute >25% of total enrolments.
- Clustering analysis identifies three groups of states with high, medium, and low enrolment growth.

### Anomalies
- Isolated spikes in update activity correspond to policy rollout periods.
- Isolation Forest flagged 7 districts with unusual enrolment patterns.

## Predictive Indicators
- Moving averages and linear regression indicate enrollment growth of 3–5% per month in top-performing states.
- Holiday-adjusted forecasts provide operational staffing recommendations.

## Impact
- **Optimized resource allocation** in high-volume regions.
- **Early warning** for unusual enrolment patterns.
- **Evidence-based policy** and planning recommendations.
